## About my tasks
Some of the task were easy.Went through many Youtube vedios to learn about the tasks.These tasks helped to increase my knowledge at the end.I couldn't all the tasks because i didnt undertand it even after going through google and youtube but still tried my best.  

## Who's me?

I am from Ernakulam.During my childhood my mother used to teach me the basics of computer.From then i was interested in things related to cumputer like programming.In my High school,I was able to do well in computer classes and it was my passion.I have some knowledge on python which i learned at school.I feel amFOSS is the right place for me where i can gain and give knowledge.
